## About Curtis Learning AR
  
**Project description:** Curtis Learning AR is a simple augmented reality demo we put together to show our clients. For this one, I did
all the backend programming to billboard the text of the 3D model we have so that it will always rotate with the camera you are holding so
you can read the text well. The video always starts playing once you have located the glyph and will replay once it's finished.
