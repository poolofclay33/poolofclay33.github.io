**Project description:** L.I.T. Flier was my second game jam game during the 2018 Global Game Jam. The theme for that year was "Lost in Transmission." Me and Nate decided to come up with a "superflight-like" game where you play as a sphere who's moving past obstacles in order to get to the finish sphere at the end of the level. 
<br />
<br />
For this game, I wanted to learn more about procedural generation so that we'd be able to spawn a certain amount of obstacles within a specified area. Luckily, I had enough time to do this and implement it in the game. I used a custom script that spawned about one hundred cubes within a larger cube that had a disabled mesh renderer. This game was a lot of fun to work on because I was able to learn something new and actually implement what I just learned into the game.
