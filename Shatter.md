**Project description:** (<i>Currently in Development</i>) I've been working on Shatter for the past couple of weeks. My main goal was to create a simple cube runner-like game at the core, but add other mechanics for the player to use within a very vibrant environment. The game is still a work in progress but the first six levels are playable as well as the gravity level.
