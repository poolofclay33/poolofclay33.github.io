## About Heir To Nothing
<i>note: download not available</i>
  
**Project description:** (<i>Currently in Development</i>) Heir To Nothing is a game I'm working on with a buddy of mine. He came up with
an idea to create a medieval builder game where you play as an heir of a king but are exiled from the kingdom and now 
you start anew by trying to build up your own kingdom and take over what you started with. 
<br />
<br />
For this game, I mainly worked on the UI and animations. Its still a work in progress since we both have other things to work on and are 
still looking for someone to work on the art for the game but we'll hopefully be able to have time to finish some of the game this coming 
summer.
