## About GSS
  
**Project description:** GSS is another augmented reality project I worked on. It features five 3D animations that play once you've located 
the glyph. You can change between the animations by selecting the buttons on the button of the screen. They all show valuable information
regarding medical equipment and other miscellaneous information. I worked on the backend programming for this project.
