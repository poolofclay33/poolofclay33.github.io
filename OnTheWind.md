**Project description:** For Runner, I wanted to work on a third-person controller that was very snappy and responsive. I haven't put too much time into Runner because of my work on Shatter, but I'd still like to revisit this game to finish development on the third-person controller and camera. For the environment, I used ProBuilder to create the platforms and obstacles the player runs on. The character model was created from scratch using MagicaVoxel. This was the first time I used voxel art for my games so it was a lot of fun to create models using voxel art.
