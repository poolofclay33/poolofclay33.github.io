## About On The Wind

**Project description:** On The Wind was a 2019 game jam game. The theme for this year's game jam was "What home means to you." 
Me, Ben and Jameel started coming up with ideas for what we took from this theme. At first, we thought of trees (for some reason) and
then elaborated on that idea to come up with a story about a dandelion that falls from a very tall tree and the premise of the game 
is to get back to the tree by climbing up towards it.

Since this was a game jam game (48 hours to develop), we ran out of time and were only able to finish a very stripped down version of a level we came up with. Regardless, it was still a lot of fun and I got to work on the music, which I made myself on the piano, and all of the UI you see in the game.
