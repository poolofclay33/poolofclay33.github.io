**Project description:** Seriously Don't Try This At Home was my first ever game jam and I wanted to include this on my portfolio to show where I started. This was a game jam ran by the Iowa State Game Development Club and took place in the fall of 2016 and the theme was "Don't Try This at Home." I had very little experience with Unity and game development at this point so this game jam was all about learning. I worked on the game with two other programmers who did the levels and transitioning whereas I worked on all the art you see in the game using my Note 5.

This first game jam was an absolute blast! I never attended an event like this before and so I got to meet a lot of new people who became my friends through the Game Development Club and was able to learn a lot about game development during the jam.
