## About AMI
  
**Project description:** The AMI app was programmed for students and professionals to submit their animations and for me to play these 
animations in a scrollable, thumbnail viewer. You can click on the selected video for it to start playing full screen and will loop
through the video once it's finished playing. You can also select a name within the index on the right-hand side of the screen to 
quickly locate a specific person's animation you want to view.
